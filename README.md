## Overview

Swin-Xception offers a novel hybrid approach to boosting performance on Facial Expression Recognition (FER) datasets, leveraging the inductive bias
and efficiency-friendly depthwise separable convolutions of Xception architecture in each Feed-Forward Network of a Swin Transformer. This presents
an accuracy boost while avoiding sky-rocketing the parameter count. Swin-Xception also demonstrates excellent competency as a vision transformer backbone
cooperates with SMOTE to refine decision boundaries for minority classes, effectively answering the class imbalance issue many FER datasets are plagued with.

## Usage

### Sourcing datasets

My dataset distributions I utilised are required to observe the reproducible results I achieved:
- RAF-DB: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuvoalok/raf-db-dataset
- FER2013: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013

They are required to be placed in the './datasets' folder located in the root as follows:
```
datasets/
├──RAF-DB/
│  ├──DATASET/
│  │  ├──test/
│  │  │  ├──angry
│  │  │  ├──disgust

```

### Training

#### End-to-End Training (Stage 1)
Saves a checkpoint to `model_checkpoints/` every epoch, and creates a state dictionary of the E2E trained model after maximum epochs reached.
This achieves `swin_xception_baseline.pth`

```bash
python main.py train\
  --epochs epochs \
```

#### SMOTE Retraining (Stages 2 & 3)
Creates a state dictionary of the complete model with SMOTE Retraining after every epoch in MLP Retraining is complete.
This achieves `swin_xception_final.pth`

```bash
python main.py smote-retrain\
```

#### Full Training Pipeline (Stages 1, 2 & 3)
Runs End-to-End training, subsequent feature extraction and SMOTE, and MLP Head Retraining on SMOTE'd dataset
Running the entire pipeline creates state dictionaries for `swin_xception_baseline.pth` and `swin_xception_final.pth`

```bash
python main.py pipeline\
  --epochs epochs \
```

### Metrics and Insights on a given Swin-Xception Instance

Each of the following scripts requires a complete working model. See [releases](https://github.com/Aura4G/Swin-Xception-for-FER/releases), or complete `train`/`smote-retrain` to
create your own state dictionaries.

#### Complete Metrics Report

Reports:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- WAR
- UAR
- Confusion Matrices
- t-SNE Clusters

```bash
python main.py metrics\
  --model-path model_path \
```

#### Grad-CAM and Inference on Individual Image

Requires a local image for inference.

```bash
python main.py gradcam\
  --model-path model_path \
  --img-path img_path \
```

#### Grad-CAM and Inference on Standardised Images

Runs inference on and produces grad-CAM insights for the first image in each class folder
of RAF-DB

```bash
python main.py gradcam-set\
  --model-path model_path \
```

## Live Demo

![Demo](https://github.com/Aura4G/Swin-Xception-for-FER/releases/download/SMOTE-Influenced/demonstration.png)

The live demo application exhibits the predictive potency of Swin-Xception, as well as some practical application, using the PyQt library.
A Haar Cascade classifier detects human faces every frame, draws a bounding box (leftmost widget), and computes inference using the
model to draw SoftMax probabilities of each expression present for that frame (top-right widget). An image display changes depending on the
prominent expression for that frame (bottom-right widget), demonstrating a slight application of the model towards behavioural assessment.

The image displays, located in `src/emotion_displays`, can be changed to any preferrable image, but they default to text labels of the expression class
(as seen in the image above). To add/replace images to be displayed in real-time, place your desired image in the `src/emotion_displays` folder, and rename
your image to any of the 7 facial expression classes (angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, surprise).

This demo requires a complete Swin-Xception state dictionary, either created during training or located in [Releases](https://github.com/Aura4G/Swin-Xception-for-FER/releases).

```bash
python live_demo.py\
```
